 Fixes:

Improvements:
1. A LED might be more stable than a diode for voltage offset
2. There are better connectors
3. The OPA140 is difficult to obtain. Alternative?
4. J2 on LED board connects to J1 on refDiode board. Confusing..
5. The connectors on the refDiode board are mirrored
6. It would be nicer if the connector to the led and refDiode board would be on the LED side.
7. More space between the resistors and the led on the led board.

8. The refDiode board is too big, remove 0.5 mm from all sides.
9. The silk screen on the photodiode board has the wrong image for BPW21.
